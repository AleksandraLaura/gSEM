# This is the repository for a short project analyzing ADHD and Migrain data with gSEM. 
The repository includes all necessary R code in the .md files.
If you prefer not to run the full pipeline, you can reproduce individual steps by using the pre-generated files available in the "IntermediateAndOutputData" directory.

The whole analysis is based on this tutorial: https://github.com/GenomicSEM/GenomicSEM/wiki/3.-Genome%E2%80%90wide-Models
